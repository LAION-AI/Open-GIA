# O-GIA: Open Generalist Interactive Agents

## Basic motivation

O-GIA stands for Open Generalist Interactive Agents. It is an umbrella for LAION backed up research, infrastructure and projects ecosystem that should provide open source, reproducible datasets, models, applications & safety tools that create foundation for and enable open usage of such generic and customizable learning agents for broad research and enthusiast community.

O-GIA systems should support various kind of **validated** and **consistency-proof** decision making, task/problem solving and assistance, acting on **multi-modal** inputs in collaboration with humans or autonomously when necessary. On longer term, they will go substantially beyond such recent interactive chat-based systems like [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), offering **consistency** and **uncertainty checking**, **self-correction** in face of likely or hinted mistakes, active acquisition of additional data when facing uncertainty, **explainability** behind offered solutions and decisions to be made, easy **customization** to special areas and adjustable degree of autonomous decision making / acting when given desirable outcomes / goals prescribed by humans in free form. 

Our vision is that collaborative research on such open systems will create **useful, personalized agents**. On the one hand, such agents will free people from executing tedious routine work that can be automatized away, allowing people to focus on creative workflows and things they truly enjoy doing. On the other, they will also perform complex assistance tasks that require creativity, like automatizing scientific research and discovery or offering customizable, personalized education to children or students of various subjects.

## Origin of the word Ogia

"Ogia" is a [Basque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language) word for "bread".

We'd like to think that as much as bread was foundational for giving people food, standing in the beginning of human civilization, OGIA components will be foundational for giving people new kind of resource - food for the new forms of creativity and inspiration based on collected wisdom and also errors we human have gathered so far, that eventually will mark next stage of developing our civilization into a better environment for everyone, increasing well-fare and decreasing suffering.

For references on the word origin, see [here](https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/ogia), [here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ogi#Basque), and [here](http://www.omegawiki.org/Expression:ogia).
